    <h2>Tostones (Fried Plantain)</h2>

    <p>
      This dish is a side, and it pairs well with almost everythingâ€”well, almost
      everything. Tostones are one of the most commonly used side dishes in the
      Dominican Republic, and you can find them here in the U.S. as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned before, they go with nearly anything, except sweet dishes.
      You can enjoy them with anything you can think of! For example, my
      <a href="../recipes/friedfish.html">fried fish recipe</a> from this
      project is a perfect match for tostones as a side.
