    <p>
      This dish is a side, and it pairs well with almost everythingâ€”well, almost
      everything. Tostones are one of the most commonly used side dishes in the
      Dominican Republic, and you can find them here in the U.S. as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned before, they go with nearly anything, except sweet dishes.
      You can enjoy them with anything you can think of! For example, my
      <a href="../recipes/friedfish.html">fried fish recipe</a> from this
      project is a perfect match for tostones as a side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 - 2 Green plantains</li>
      <li>1/2 - 1 Cup of frying oil</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to cook this</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peeling the green plantains
        <p>
          Peeling the plantains. If you don't know how to do this part, I'll
          link a video
          <a
            href="https://youtu.be/SvHuDzJLJec?si=YTVNl_V2X98oNmgr"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >here</a
          >, it's not that hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          (NOTE: Make sure that the green plantains are not cold, warm is better
          to strip them.)
        </p>
        <p>
          After peeling the plantains, we will cut them in about 1 - 1.5 inch
          thick.
        </p>
        <p>
          (NOTE: We use 1 - 2 green plantains depending on how many people are
          eating or if you eating alone, they are addictive.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Frying the plantain 1st time
        <p>
          Now that we have this green plantains peel and cut, we'll move on the
          next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          (NOTE: Before proceeding, if you don't feel safe with this next step
          stop! And just use an air fryer to do this.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In a pot add your frying oil, set the stove to medium high heat. Wait
          until is hot enough and place your green cut plantains, in the hot
          oil, slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait until they are yellow, like shiny beautiful yellow and take them
          out of the pot. Now don't forget lower the stove heat to the lowers
          setting, to prevent from burning the oil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Mashing the plantains
        <p>
          Now grab somthing to smash the plantains like a cup, with a fat
          bottom, a bowl anything will work and smash the plantain to about 1/4
          to 1/2 of an inch
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Finishing part
        <p>
          Now after all of them are mashed, put the stove heat back to medium
          high heat and place the green plantains in the oil again. Wait until
          the look and feel harder them before, and take them out, don't let
          them burn now.
        </p>
        <p>
          (NOTE: Don't lower the heat when taking them out if you do, it will
          add more oil to the inside of the plantains just wait until they are
          out and then turn off the stove.)
        </p>
        <p>Now add some salt when they hot so it can melt right into it.</p>
        <p>
          Extra, for more taste to this side dish, people also mixes ketchup
          with mayo, and black pepper in a side container as a dipping sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you've completed this delicious side dish, <q>Buen Provecho</q>
