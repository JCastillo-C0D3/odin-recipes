        This dish is a side, and it pairs well with almost everything, well,
        almost everything. Tostones are one of the most commonly used side
        dishes in the Dominican Republic. You can also find them here in the U.S
        even in the Chinese restaurants, you are able to find this side dish.

      <p>
        As mentioned before, they go with nearly anything, except sweet dishes.
        You can enjoy them with anything you can think of! For example, my
        <a class="refer" href="../recipes/friedfish.html">fried fish recipe</a>
        from this project is a perfect match for this tostones as a side. This
        is a very easy to make side dish, and it's also inexpensive as well as
        the

          Peeling the green plantains
          <p>
            Peeling the plantains, if you don't know how to do this part, I'll
            share this link of a video

              >here</a
            >, it's not that hard.
          </p>
          <p>
            (NOTE: Make sure that the green plantains are not cold, warm is
            better to strip them.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After peeling the plantains, we will cut them in about 1 - 1.5 inch
            thick.
          </p>
          <p>
            (NOTE: We use 1 - 2 green plantains depending on how many people are
            eating or if you eating alone, they are addictive.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Frying the plantain 1st time
          <p>
            Now that we have this green plantains peel and cut, we'll move on
            the next step.
          </p>
          <p>
            (NOTE: Before proceeding, if you don't feel safe with this next step
            stop! And just use an air fryer to do this.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In a pot add your frying oil, set the stove to medium high heat.
            Wait until is hot enough and place your green cut plantains, in the
            hot oil, slowly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wait until they are yellow, like shiny beautiful yellow and take
            them out of the pot. Now don't forget lower the stove heat to the
            lowers setting, to prevent from burning the oil.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mashing the plantains
          <p>
            Now grab somthing to smash the plantains like a cup, with a fat
            bottom, a bowl anything will work and smash the plantain to about
            1/4 to 1/2 of an inch
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Finishing part
          <p>
            Now after all of them are mashed, put the stove heat back to medium
            high heat and place the green plantains in the oil again. Wait until
            the look and feel harder them before, and take them out, don't let
            them burn now.
          </p>
          <p>
            (NOTE: Don't lower the heat when taking them out if you do, it will
            add more oil to the inside of the plantains just wait until they are
            out and then turn off the stove.)
          </p>
          <p>Now add some salt when they hot so it can melt right into it.</p>
          <p>
            Extra, for more taste to this side dish, people also mixes ketchup
            with mayo, and black pepper in a side container as a dipping sauce.
          </p>
