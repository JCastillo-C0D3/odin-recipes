In this project we'll first practice what am learning in The Odin Project.

Also this is only the beginning of this life time career that i'm practicing for.

Now about this project i want to create a nice very attractive and colorful web that will show different items and links to more things created by me and also make this a great way to learn.

This path of coding and learning is a never ending path like the doctors that they never finish leaning but this is why is so good because you always learning new thing and make it new thing to make it look cooler then before im only a newbie but i have big dreams about coding.
