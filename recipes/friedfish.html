    <h2>Pescado a la Boca Chica(Boca Chica Style Fried Fish)</h2>
    <p>
      This is a very famous dish in <em>Dominican Republic</em> specially if you
      from the city. This dish is part of are culture, the name come from the
      place where the Fish is catch and made. Since it's catch and fried in the
      same place. This beach is call Boca Chica that it translate to (small
      mouth), it's very known in the country. For the atraction and also the
      food and adventure that you'll have there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most amazing thing about this dish is not buying it to take it home,
      is eating it right there in the same place where the catch it. The place,
      the people, the weather, the love this locals put to making this dish a
      memory for you to remember and everything give that dish flavor. Theres
      places here in NY where I live now that make this dish but this amazing
      fried fish but nothing like home made nothing like Boca Chica Fried Fish.
      But never the less if you want to make it home I'll add the ingredient at
      the bottom.
