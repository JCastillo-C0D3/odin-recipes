    <h3>Pescado a la Boca Chica(Boca Chica Style Fried Fish)</h3>

      This is a very famous dish in <em>Dominican Republic</em> specially if you
      from the city. This dish is part of are culture, the name come from the
      place where is catch and made. because they catch this fish and fried in
      the same place. This place is a tourist and local place because is a beach

      The most amazing thing about this dish is not buying it to take it home,
      is eating it right there in the same place where the catch it. The place,
      the people, the weather, the love this locals put to making this dish a
      memory for you to remember and everything give that dish flavor. Theres
      places here in NY where I live now that make this dish but this amazing
      fried fish but nothing like home made nothing like Boca Chica Fried Fish.
