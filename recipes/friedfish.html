      <p>
        This is a very famous dish in <em>Dominican Republic</em> especially if
        you from the city. This dish is part of our culture, the name comes from
        the place where the fish is caught and made. Since it's caught and fried
        in the same place. This beach is called Boca Chica that translate to
        'small mouth', it's very known in the country. For the attraction and
        also the food and adventure that you'll have there.

    <div class="description part-2">
      <p>
        The most amazing thing about this dish is not buying it to take it home,
        is eating it right there in the same place where they catch it. The
        place, the people, the weather, the love these locals put into making
        this dish a memory for you to remember and everything give that dish
        flavor. There are places here in NY where I live now that make this
        dish, but nothing like home made nothing like Boca Chica Fried fish.
        Anyways never the less if you want to make it at home I'll add the
        ingredients at the bottom, and the steps to make it.

            done now take the 1st seasoning the one with the garlic and put it
            all over the fish from the inside out. Make sure to put some in
            those diagonal cuts you made early.

          <p class="cooking">
            After making sure that there's seasoning everywhere in the fish from

            put it all over the fish as well. make sure that you can't see the
            skin of the fish with the flour and adobo all over the fish. (Note:
            Don't over do this put enough flour seasoning but don't over
            seasoning it will lose the flavor if you do.)

          <p class="warning-note">
            (Note: Be careful! Hot oil can be dangerous. If you don't feel safe
            frying, just turn off the stove and try grilling the fish instead,
            or air frying. It will still taste great, and it's a safer option.)
          </p>
          <p class="cooking">
