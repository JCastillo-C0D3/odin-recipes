        <!-- Description of about this dish -->
        This is a very famous dish in <em>Dominican Republic</em> specially if
        you from the city. This dish is part of our culture, the name come from
        the place where the fish is caught and made. Since it's catch and fried
        in the same place. This beach is called Boca Chica that it translate to
        (small mouth), it's very known in the country. For the attraction and
        also the food and adventure that you'll have there.

        The most amazing thing about this dish is not buying it to take it home,
        is eating it right there in the same place where the catch it. The
        place, the people, the weather, the love this locals put to making this
        dish a memory for you to remember and everything give that dish flavor.
        There are places here in NY where I live now that make this dish but
        this amazing fried fish but nothing like home made nothing like Boca
        Chica Fried fish. But never the less if you want to make it home I'll

  <div class="cooking-fish">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose the fish
        <p class="cooking-p">Pick your favorite fish to try with this dish.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Seasoning mixes
        <p class="cooking-p">
          Smash or blend garlic clove. Mix in the garlic, salt, Dominican
          oregano, and the black pepper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        mix the coating
        <p class="cooking-p">
          Now take the a separate bowl or container and mix in the flour with a
          little of the adobo.
        </p>
        <p class="safe-note">
         (NOTE: This is optional)
          You can add some extra ingredients if you like, to this mix. Add a
          little of pepper, paprika and you favorite spice for more color and
          taste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the fish
        <p class="cooking-p">
          Now take the fish clean and dry and make a couple of diagonal cuts to
          it, do this for both sides of the fish. After you have this cuts done
          now take the 1st seasoning the one with the garlic and put it all over
          the fish from the inside out. Make sure to put some in those diagonal
          cuts you made early.
        </p>

        <p class="cooking-p">
          After making sure that theres seasoning everywhere in the fish from
          the inside out, now take the 2nd coating, the one with the flour and
          put it all over the fish as well. make sure that you can't see the
          skin of the fish with the flour and adobo all over the fish. (Note:
          Don't over do this put enough flour seasoning but don't over seasoning
          it will lose the flavor if you do.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fried the Fish
        <p class="cooking-p">
          Okay almost done, keep up with me. Alright in a pot place some oil. Now wait until the oil is
          hot not too hot but hot like you will fried an egg.
        </p>
        <p class="warning-note">
            (Note: Be careful! Hot oil can be dangerous. If you don't feel safe
            frying, just turn off the stove and try grilling the fish instead,
            or air frying. It will still taste great, and it's a safer option.)
        </p>
        <p class="cooking-p">
          Slowly place the fish inside the pot and let it cook slowly but
          shortly. flip it from side to side if need it to until the white flour
          start to get yellow keep flipping it from side to side when is nice
          and it's smell like is cook, Don't let it burn now take it out. Place
          it in a separate bowl with paper towel on it that will suck up all the
          extra oil on the fish.
        </p>
      </li>
